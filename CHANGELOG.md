# Version 1.0.42

Changed the round marker chat message styling so that it works correctly in PF2

Fixed an minor issue where unreachable code was being reported.  Although technically correct... it's code that's never reached anyways.

# Version 1.0.38

Added a setting so that repositioning the collapse button of the sidebar menu isn't always on.  I liked having the collapse/expand button stay in the same general area, but there are a couple of UI stylings that aren't expecting this and put it in a weird location, making it difficult to expand the sidebar once collapsed.

Turn marker has been updated with cleaner graphics.  Thank you Verthiss!

Removed some debugging information and put others behind a debug setting so there's less chatter in the console log.

Added option to remove the combat turn marker after the first move.

Added option to have a custom turn marker image for individual tokens.

Fixed issue with the turn marker pulse animation

Added option to remember the previous target per each token.  So you can clear targets as the turn changes, but when it comes back to that token it will retarget the last thing it had targetted.  Will not retarget a token that is now invisible, or has died/ been defeated.

Added option to use wildcards with round and turn sounds

Fixed issue where showing the start spot was only showing for the player that moved the token.  Now it will show for both the GM and that player.

Added option to sort statuses.  So altering the Token HUD is now independant of sorting the statuses in the HUD.

Added a "Find my Token" button to the Token menu.  Just in case you're not sure where your token is, you can click the button to find it.  Doesn't work for the GM as the GM owns all tokens.

And the combat tracker will now popout for tokens that have been added mid-combat.

# Version 1.0.37

Fixed libWrapper issues with Bloodsplats and Combat bars

Added the volume option back to the settings.  Apparently the sound files were really loud.

Added Italian language, thank you Luisphigor

Updated Spanish language, thank you as always Lozalojo

# Version 1.0.36

Split some of the functionality into separate files to make debugging a little easier.

Fixed compatibility issue with Hidden Initiative.  Hidden Initiative is doing some strange things with getting the Combat Tracker data that locks out other modules from modifying the data.  I did my best to work around it.

Disabled the next turn notification when Hidden Initiative is active.

Added round markers, so a small chat message is added at the start, end, and when a round changes so you can see what happened during what round.

Added 'none' animation so you can display a solid image that doesn't move.

Fixed issue with CR calculations.  It was having a hard time with single creatures.

Added option to change the default bloodsplat colour, and to change the bloodsplat colour for individuals.

Made the layer switching keys a little more generic so that any module that adds a layer can be included.

Added a placeholder for tokens to denote the starting spot of their combat turn.

# Version 1.0.35

Added proper challenge rating lables for Pathfinder.  The calulations were corrected but the terminology was DnD5e rather than Pathfinder.

Updated the code to use different variable names than icon as I thought it might be causing a conflict.  Turns out it wasn't but it's probably more readable anyways.

Changed the Clear Targets setting so that players could also use this.  Default is one for GM and off for Players.

Added styling for the new Tile HUD icons.  They aren't in quite the same format as the old ones so the highlighting was being missed.

Fixed issues with PF2E getting encounter ratings.  There was a change with how to find character levels.

Added combat turn marker animation options, now you can have the animation go counter-clockwise, pulse, fade in, and fade out.  No more boring clockwise rotation.

Fixed issue where deleting a combatant token would prevent it from being added back to the scene.

# Version 1.0.34
Fixing issue with Pathfinder dead status and bloodsplats

Fixed an issue where the layer swap keys were accesible to players

Updated spanish translations, thank you lozalojo

Wrapped the wall points with libWrapper

# Version 1.0.33

Enhanced the option to drag wall points together.  Before it just updated after you moved the wall, now it will drag the points together.

Updated the sounds so that the GM is in charge of what sound is played but players (and GM) and choose what sounds they want to hear.  By default the Next Turn, and Your Turn sounds are turned off for the GM.

Removed the volume setting for the combat sounds.  It should default to the system levels rather than being hidden in a module setting.

Fixed an issue where estimating CR of a combat was listing the players levels as 0

Changed the sound settings so that they're more compact.

Updated the /timer chat command so you can now have it count up or down, set it to track minutes or hours. Have it display flavor text.  And have it display another chat message when the timer runs out.

Removed the disable open combat setting as there are modules out there that can help you set players settings.

Tried to fix issue with defeated not setting the token status to dead.

MERGE CODE: Added option to set autodefeated on negative rather than 0.  Thank you pseudocode.

# Version 1.0.32

Fixing issue with libWrapper integration

# Version 1.0.31

Added option to select sounds with wildcards

Fixed an issue where the palette button would duplicate if multiple scene configs were opened up.

Fixed a bloodsplat issue that couldn't find the correct sized font, so the image would be off center.

Fixed issue where the skull overlay would show briefly before the bloodsplat redraws.

If auto defeated is enabled, set the token to the defeated status too, not just the combat defeated status.  This was causing some weird issues when the combat ended and some tokens stopped being bloodsplats.

Fixed issues with Warhammer positioning of expand 

# Version 1.0.27
File name accidentally changed to .svg, restored it back to .png

# Version 1.0.26

File optimization, Thank you xdy!

# Version 1.0.25
Fixing issues with the combat resource bars.

Adding option to move the pause icon

Adding option to sort token statues by column rather than row.

# Version 1.0.22
Added option to use different setting for resource bars when the token is in combat.  This will also display a see through version of the bar for hover and controlled option until the token is hovered or controlled.  This should make it easier to set the bars to not be seen during regular movement, but have them show once combat starts.

Added interface with DF Library Hotkeys to show hotkey settings just for Monks Little Details.

# Version 1.0.21
Adding option to auto-defeat players aswell as npc's.

Moved the game paused icon up a bit more so that it's obvious the game is paused.  If it's too low down it can be missed.

Added a fixed maximum width to select boxes in a form.  If the text is too big it'll drop to the next line.  Still unsure if this is too big of a change though, not entirely sure of the consequences.  But I find it interesting that the input fields are a fized width, but the select fields are not.

Whenever the turn changes, remove targets if you are the GM.

# Version 1.0.20
Don't mind me, just trying to find a set of keys that aren't used by other things and don't cause issues with Foundry.

# Version 1.0.19
Fixed issue with quick viewing layers, by using Library: DF Hotkeys.  Awesome module by the way.  It's not a requirement for Monks Little Details as it will check to see if you need to to be installed, but will warn you to install it if you want the feature.

# Version 1.0.17
Fixing styling with the token HUD in Pathfinder.

Changing the location of stacked condition indicator in PF2

Adding the option to briefly switch between layers by holding down a key and pressing Shift+key will change the layer.  This should let you switch briefly to another layer such as the Tiles layer to hide or show a tile before releasing the key and going back tot he token layer.  Current keys are assigned as r=tokens, t-tiles, y-lighting, u-sounds, i-terrain (if you have the Terrain Layer module installed)

# Version 1.0.16
Adding option to not highlight the image in the Token HUD.  If the system uses full colour images, then highlighting it just distorts the image.

Updated the background palette so that it only loads after clicking a button.  Saves on refresh speed.

Added context menu to view scene artwork in a compendium.  Always found it difficult to select a map if I wasn't sure what I was looking at.  This should allow you to see the whole map before importing it.

Automatically set the defeated status to an NPC that's in combat and drops to 0 HP.

Allow the monster sound effect to be stopped if you press the speaker a second time while it's playing.

Fixing issues with PF2E styling of Token HUD items.  The stackable items weren't getting the right styles.

# Version 1.0.7
Added option to change which key moves tokens

Updated the code that moves the characters to move them as a batch, rather than individually

Added the option to prevent tokens being removed from a combat encounter via the token HUD.  They can still be removed from the Encounter Interface.
